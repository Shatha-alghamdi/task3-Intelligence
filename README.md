# Introduction:
## Using Arduino to turn on an LED when HuskyLens detects a face

# Requirements:
-HuskyLens AI-based vision sensor
-LED
-concction wires
-Breadboard
-Arduino

## Implementation Steps:

1. Connect the HuskyLens SDA to the Arduino Mega SDA (pin 20).

2. Connect the HuskyLens SCL to the Arduino Mega SCL (pin 21).

3. Connect the LED to pin 9 of the Arduino.

4. Ensure all ground (GND) connections are made to complete the circuit.

5. Download and install the HuskyLens library from the Arduino Library Manager.

# After the connections and coding are done, we now have the ability to detect faces using AI. When a face is detected, the LED will turn on, and when a face is not recognized, the LED will turn off.
